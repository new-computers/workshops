**Being a Body**

Assume the identity of something huge and inhuman ... a company, physical infrastructure, a non government organization, etc.

Gather a set of random resources and a single goal, these are uniquely yours.

Consider how to implement your given resources to reach your goal, and what you might need from others.

When the time comes, trade resources with someone representing/embodying another infrastructure.

Write/tell a short story about this interaction, and how your infrastructure does, or does not accomplish its goal.
